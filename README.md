### Hosted Application:
https://giftr-registry.herokuapp.com/

### Usage:
On loading the home page, choose to create a new registry, show all registries, or search by a registry name. Below that are user reviews, and the opportunity to add your own review of the site.

Once on a registry page, either through creating, picking, or searching for one, the user can add gifts to the list. These gifts have names, thumbnails, and a link to follow that will bring the user to a page where they can purchase said gift.
